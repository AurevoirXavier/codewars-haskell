[Infinite list of 1's](https://www.codewars.com/kata/infinite-list-of-1-s/train/haskell)

Your task is to write function 'getInfiniteListOfOnes', which returns, well, an infinite list of 1's.

Problem seems to be trivial but there are some limitations: take, repeat, cycle and replicate are hidden.

## Thinking

Just use **range**.
