[How many twos?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/how-many-twos/train/haskell)

Write a function that returns the number of '2's in the factorization of a number.
For example,

```haskell
twoCount 24
```

should return 3, since the factorization of 24 is 2^3 x 3

```haskell
twoCount 17280
```

should return 7, since the factorization of 17280 is 2^7 x 5 x 3^3
The number passed to two_count (twoCount) will always be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.

**Recursion** or **Iter**.
