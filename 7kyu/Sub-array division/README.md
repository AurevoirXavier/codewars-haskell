[Sub-array division](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59eb64cba954273cd4000099)

In this Kata, you will be given an array of numbers and a number `n`, and your task will be to determine if `any`array elements, when summed (or taken individually), are divisible by `n`. 

For example:

-   `solve([1,3,4,7,6],9) = True`, because `3 + 6` is divisible by `9`;  `solve([1,2,3,4,5],10) = True` for similar reasons.
-   `solve([8,5,3,9],7) = True)`, because `7` evenly divides `5 + 9`, but `solve([8,5,3],7) = False`.

More examples in the test cases.

Good luck!
