[Multiply characters](https://www.codewars.com/kata/multiply-characters/train/haskell)

Here we have a function that help us spam our hearty laughter. But is not working! I need you to find out why...

Expected results:

```haskell
spam  1 -- hue
spam  6 -- huehuehuehuehuehue
spam 14 -- huehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehuehue
```

## Thinking

Just `replicate` it.
