## Detail

[Remove exclamation marks](https://www.codewars.com/kata/remove-exclamation-marks/train/haskell)

Write function RemoveExclamationMarks which removes all exclamation marks from a given string.

## Thinking

Just `elem` it. But I made a mistake here, I think the kata told me to remove all the punctuation.
