## Detail

[Powers of 2](https://www.codewars.com/kata/powers-of-2/train/haskell)

Write a function `powersOfTwo` which will return list of all powers of 2 from 0 to n (where n is an exponent).

E.g:

n = 0 -> 2^0 -> [1]

n = 1 -> 2^0, 2^1 -> [1,2]

n = 2 -> 2^0, 2^1, 2^2 -> [1,2,4]

## Thinking

Try to solve it with pointless. (tips: `enumFromTo` might be help)
