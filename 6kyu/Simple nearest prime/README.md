## Detail

[Simple nearest prime](https://www.codewars.com/kata/simple-nearest-prime/train/haskell)

In this Kata, you will be given a number and your task will be to return the nearest prime number. 

```haskell
solve(4) = 3. The nearest primes are 3 and 5. If difference is equal, pick the lower one. 
solve(125) = 127
```

We'll be testing for numbers up to `10^10`. `500` tests.

More examples in test cases. 

Good luck!
