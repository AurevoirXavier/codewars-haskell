## Detail

[String array revisal](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59f08f89a5e129c543000069)

In this Kata, you will be given an array of strings and your task is to remove all consecutive duplicate letters from each string in the array.

For example: 

-   `dup(["abracadabra","allottee","assessee"]) = ["abracadabra","alote","asese"]`. 
-   `dup(["kelless","keenness"]) = ["keles","kenes"]`.

Strings will be alphabet characters only. Don't worry about lower and upper case. See test cases for more examples. 

Good luck!

## Thinking

Just `group`. Or you can `fold` it like me.
